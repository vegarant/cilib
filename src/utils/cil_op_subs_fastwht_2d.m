% Two dimensional subsampled fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. The transform is
% normalized, so that the transform becomes unitary. 
%
% INPUT
% X     - Matrix to be transformed, written as a column vector.
% mode  - If mode is not equal to 1, the transpose matrix product will be applied. 
%        Otherwise the usual matrix product will be applied.
% N     - The size of X as a NÃ—N-matrix.
% idx   - Linear indices of the samples one would like to obtain.  
% order - The order of the Walsh-Hadamard transform. 
%           * 'sequency' (default)
%           * 'hadamard' 
%           * 'dyadic'
%
% OUTPUT
% Y - The transformed matrix
%
