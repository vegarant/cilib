% This function acts as a matrix product between a hadamard matrix and a
% inverse daubechies wavelet matrix, both in two dimensions. the resulting
% matrix is subsampled by the linear indices specified by `idx`. 
%
% INPUT:
% x    - Column vector. The vector will be reshaped to the two dimensional
%        matrix X.
% mode - If mode is not equal to 1, the transpose matrix product will be applied. 
%        Otherwise the usual matrix product will be applied.
% N    - Size of x as a NÃ—N-matrix.
% idx  - Linear indices of the samples one would like to obtain.  
% nres - Number of wavelet resolution spaces.
% wname - Name of the wavelet
% perm  - A vector with the integers 1:N permuted. 
% perm_rev  - Reverse permutation (call `perm_rev(perm) = 1:N`).
% hadamard_order - The order of the Hadamard matrix (optional).  
%           * 'sequency' (default)
%           * 'hadamard' 
%           * 'dyadic'
%
% OUTPUT:
% y - The two dimensional signal, reshaped into a vector.
%
% SEE ALSO:
% `sub2ind`, `fastwht`, `cil_op_fastwht_2dd`, `DWT2Impl` and `IDWT2Impl`.
